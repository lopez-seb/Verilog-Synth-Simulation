# Simulation grade sound Synthesizer

This project was made for simulation and not synthesis onto an FPGA as it was designed and coded before the key differences were discovered.

the file **new** contains all of the .v files for creating the project. 

The files in sources are required as they implement the look-up table containing all of the necessary data. Only one of them is necessary? Believed to be LUT_mk3_3

the .coe files were used to generate the look-up tables should the user want to generate them themselves.
